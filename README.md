# Sierra-Auto-Dealer
Spring Maven Project

This is my first mostly functional web project using Spring. Although the project is functional, it does not
conform to the standards of most car dealer websites. It is not credential dependent (user/admin) nor do some 
of the features work or work correctly. As I was building this project I realized there were much better ways to perform 
operations, but because of time I was not able to fix them.
